# FileSharing

## To do

* Fix known issues (see below)
* ContentType filter option on search
* Download previewed video/audio if it was already preloaded into the client computer as those are the original files already
* Make the download button more obvious (thanks Loluh)
* Remake Upload
  * Drag & Drop upload
  * List files which will be uploaded and let the user cancell some of them
* You tell me

## Known Issues

* Infinite scroll weird behaviour on phone 
* Upload on large files is failing currently

## Fixed Issues

* Search no showing correctly on phone
* Redesign Search Pannel (Not good but usable on pghones now)
* Better overall css
* Infinite scroll not working on phone
